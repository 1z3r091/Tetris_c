# Tetris_in_C

## Description

Tetris source code from soen.kr

## Dependencies

- C

## What I have done

- deleted Turboc.h
- deleted some macros which were defined in Turboc.h

1. my_tetris.c

- Analysed the original tetris source code and reprogrammed tetris by using its algorithm
- added some features (f.e. showNextBlock etc.)

2. my_tetris_2player.c

- Same as my_tetris but added 2 player mode
